##### 3 Station IPPT

##### Every year, able-bodied Singaporean males who are in or have completed compulsory military training (a.k.a. National Service) have to take the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT). The IPPT is a physical fitness test meant to assess the fitness of our soldiers to ensure that our soldiers are physically fit in times of uncertainty. In 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced a new test format and scoring system for IPPT, which was implemented in 2015. The new IPPT consists of the following 3 stations:

##### • Push-up, which measures upper body strength
##### • Sit-up, which measures abdominal strength
##### • 2.4km Run, which measures cardiovascular fitness and lower body strength

##### Soldiers participating in the 3-station IPPT will first attempt as many push-ups and situps that they can do in one minute each. Depending on their age, they are given points based on the number of repetitions they have completed. Next, they have to complete a 2.4km run, and would be given points depending on how fast they complete the run. The final IPPT score is the sum of all the scores obtained at the 3 stations, which determines if they have passed or failed the IPPT. To reward and motivate soldiers to maintain a high level of fitness, a monetary reward is given for soldiers who have demonstrated a high level of physical fitness. The reward amount depends on the final score obtained, and can be broken down into Pass, Pass with Incentive, Silver, and Gold. This is known as the IPPT Award.
